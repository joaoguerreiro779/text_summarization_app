# Coach Hub Interview Challenge
Repository for the technical assignment for Coach Hub

**Contents**:
1. [Development Environment](#development-environment)
2. [Building the server with docker](#building-the-server-with-docker)

## **Development Environment**

In order to run through all the steps of this README you must make sure you have `Docker` working on your machine. 
The stack used for this project was:
 - [Windows 10 host machine]
 - [Windows Subsystem for Linux 2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)
 - [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
 - [Ubuntu 20.06](https://www.microsoft.com/store/productId/9N9TNGVNDL3Q)
 - [Pyenv (Python 3.8.7)](https://pypi.org/project/pyenv/)
 - [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)


You don't need to have this exact stack, however you do need to have a linux machine, docker and preferably a virtual environment.

To start, clone this repo:

`git clone https://github.com/joaoguerreiro779/coachhub_challenge.git`

Poetry will always work isolated from the global Python installation. To achieve this, it will first check if it’s currently running inside a virtual environment. If it is, it will use it directly without creating a new one. But if it’s not, it will use one that it has already created or create a brand new one for you. By default, Poetry will try to use the currently activated Python version to create the virtual environment for the current project.

However, for various reasons, this Python version might not be compatible with the python required for the project. To ensure that this does not happen we will use pyenv to activate a specific python version. 

Install the pyenv dependencies (for Ubuntu 20.06)


`sudo apt-get update; sudo apt-get install make build-essential libssl-dev zlib1g-dev \`
`libbz2-dev libreadline-dev libsqlite3-dev wget curl llvm \`
`libncursesw5-dev xz-utils tk-dev libxml2-dev libxmlsec1-dev libffi-dev liblzma-dev`

Get pyenv installer

`curl https://pyenv.run | bash`

Optionally, add `pyenv` to path by adding the following to the ~/.bashrc file

`export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"`

`export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"`

`eval "$(pyenv init --path)"`

Then, to install the specific `python` version (we will install `python 3.8.7`) run:

`pyenv install 3.8.7`

Clone repo

`git clone https://github.com/joaoguerreiro779/coachhub_challenge.git`

`cd coachhub_challenge`

Activate pyenv for the project

`pyenv local 3.8.7`

Download and install poetry

`curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python -`

`poetry install`

## **Building the server with Docker**

To build the server with docker, navigate to the server directory and build the docker image with:

`docker build -t coachhub_challenge_server .`

Then run this image on a container exposing host port 5000 to container port 3000

`docker run -p 5000:3000 coachhub_challenge_server`
